## Recursion

###  i will explain the Recursion

#### What is Recursion?
The process in which a function calls itself
directly or indirectly is called recursion
and the corresponding function is called a
recursive function. Using a recursive 
algorithm, certain problems can be solved
quite easily. Examples of such problems 
are Towers of Hanoi (TOH),
Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals,
DFS of Graph, etc. A recursive function
solves a particular problem by calling
a copy of itself and solving smaller
sub problems of the original problems.
Many more recursive calls can be generated
as and when required. 
It is essential to know that we
should provide a certain case in 
order to terminate this recursion process.
So we can say that every time the function 
calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.

Need of Recursion

Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which we
can reduce the length of our code and make it easier
to read and write. It has certain advantages over
the iteration technique which will be discussed later.
A task that can be defined with its similar subtask,
recursion is one of the best solutions for it. For example;
The Factorial of a number.

Properties of Recursion:
* Performing the same operations multiple times with different inputs.
* In every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
* Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise infinite loop will occur

Base function example
#### factory
```csharp
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```
